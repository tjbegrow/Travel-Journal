        "description": "I walked so much this day that I'm pretty sure that 90% of my day was walking. It didn't matter that it was raining at all I was just so excited to be in Japan and that I would go up into Tokyo Tower. Also, I went to CoCo Ichibayna for the first time. All I can say is the カレーライス was far better than anything I could have made at home. The inspiration has stayed with me and now I'm on a quest to make the best カレーライス!"

        "description": "The Journey to Hakone was a relaxing one. I took the Romance Train from Shinjuku station in Tokyo to Odwara Station. The seasonal bento I bought was very good. After reaching station, I took the bus the rest of the way to Lake Ashi. Once I checked into my hotel, I took the pirate ship across the lake to the other side. It was quite fun. The weather wasn't great, but I was just glad to be there. I made it to the Peace Torii at about 3pm after getting mochi and tea at Amazake Chaya."
