It didn't matter that it was raining at all I was just so excited to be in Japan and that I would go up into Tokyo Tower. Also, I went to CoCo Ichibayna for the first time. All I can say is the カレーライス was far better than anything I could have made at home. The inspiration has stayed with me and now I'm on a quest to make the best カレーライス!"
